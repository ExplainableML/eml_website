# Ph.D. Positions

## Applying as a Ph.D. student to our group

We usually hire students via centralized calls, i.e. the *European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems* ([ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc)) Ph.D. Program.
ELLIS is a vibrant research community with top researchers in various fields of machine learning, AI, and robotics. If you want to join us for your Ph.D., consider applying through their annual call!


## Applying as a visiting Ph.D. student

Are you doing your Ph.D. in another lab but your research has a lot in common with ours? Or your research projects and ours are orthogonal but might mutually benefit each other? 
Then come visiting us! Check the [contact page](/#contact) and reach us out.
