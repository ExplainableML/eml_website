# Profile
Leander Girrbach is a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata).
He received his bachelor's degree in computational linguistics from Heidelberg University in 2021 and his master's degree also in computational linguistics from the University of TÃ¼bingen in 2023.

His primary interests center around gaining a better understanding of deep learning models - understanding how neural networks work and constructing models that are more interpretable.
