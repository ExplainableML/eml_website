# Profile
Almut Sophia Koepke is a post-doctoral researcher in the EML group where she works with [Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata). Prior to that, she completed her DPhil in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Andrew Zisserman](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/).

During her PhD, her research focussed on self-supervised learning and on audio-visual learning problems.
