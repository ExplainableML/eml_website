# Profile
I'm a PhD student in the Autonomous Vision Group (AVG) as part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS), advised by Andreas Geiger and Zeynep Akata.

I completed my master's degree at Heilbronn University where I worked with Nicolaj Stache. For my master's thesis I spent time at VGG working on sign language segmentation with GÃ¼l Varol and Samuel Albanie.
