# Research
Yongqin Xian is mainly interested in solving computer vision tasks with limited supervision. For instance, zero-shot learning that learns to recognize unseen classes without any labeled data and few-shot learning that learns to recognize novel classes with only few labeled data. Besides, he is also interested in related topics on semi-supervised, unsupervised learning and self-supervised learning.
