# Profile
I am Ph.D. candidate at [IMPRS-IS Program, TÃ¼bingen](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), where I am part of [EML](https://www.eml-unitue.de/) and [MIDAS](http://midaslab.org/) group. I am fascinated by interdisciplinary R&D happening at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Biomedical and Healthcare Informatics. These days I am exploring Bayesian Deep Learning, Uncertainty Estimation, Generative models, and Explainable AI. 
I was an undergrad at [Computer Science and Engineering@IIT-Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/).

<br>

Earlier, I spent some time as a research intern at **Amazon Science**, **Microsoft Research**, **Honda Research Institute**, and **Nanyang Technological University-Singapore**. Besides, I've also spent time working with medical imaging startups and as a quantitative researcher for algorithmic trading firm.
