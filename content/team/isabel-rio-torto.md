# Profile
Isabel Rio-Torto is a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Porto, Portugal, and a researcher at the Visual Computing and Machine Intelligence Group (VCMI) of INESC TEC. She is also an invited teaching assistant at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Porto (FEUP), where she received her master's degree in Electrical and Computers Engineering in 2019. Her master thesis focused on inherently interpretable deep learning models, specifically on visual explanations. 

Her PhD, supervised by Prof. Lu√≠s F. Teixeira and Prof. Jaime Cardoso, is somewhat of an extension of the previous work, focusing now on multimodal learning and multimodal explanations, mainly in natural language.
