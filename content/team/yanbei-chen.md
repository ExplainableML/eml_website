# Research
Yanbei Chen’s general research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, particularly in semi-/un-/self-supervised learning and multimodal learning. In her Ph.D., she has been researching visual learning in the limited-label regime, including semi-supervised, unsupervised, and cross-domain learning algorithms to tackle computer vision tasks with minimal human supervision. In the long run, she will explore multimodal learning algorithms that could connect, correlate, or integrate multiple input modalities in an explainable and interpretable manner.
