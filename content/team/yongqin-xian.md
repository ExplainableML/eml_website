# Profile
Yongqin Xian is currently a post-doctoral researcher with [Luc Van Gool](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/people-details.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC8zMjQ4LC0xOTcxNDY1MTc4.html) in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. He completed his PhD summa cum laude at the [Max Planck Institute Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/) under the supervision of [Bernt Schiele](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/bernt-schiele) and [Zeynep Akata](https://eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata). He was a research intern with [Lorenzo Torresani](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~lorenzo/home.html) at Facebook AI. His research focuses on learning with limited supervision for computer vision tasks.

# Research
Yongqin Xian is mainly interested in solving computer vision tasks with limited supervision. For instance, zero-shot learning that learns to recognize unseen classes without any labeled data and few-shot learning that learns to recognize novel classes with only few labeled data. Besides, he is also interested in related topics on semi-supervised, unsupervised learning and self-supervised learning.
