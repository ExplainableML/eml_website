# Profile
Lukas is currently pursuing his PhD under joined supervision of Zeynep Akata (at Helmholtz Munich and TUM) and Matthias Bethge (at the University of TÃ¼bingen) as part of the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS). He obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in Industrial Engineering and Management from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). While studying, Lukas completed internships at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart and at Ernst & Young in Berlin.

His main research interest is to understand model transfer across distribution shifts. Currently, his work focuses on continually shifting data distributions, i.e. continual learning.
