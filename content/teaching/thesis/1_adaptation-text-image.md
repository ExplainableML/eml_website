title: Adaptation of Text-to-Image Models
description: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have excelled in crafting visually appealing images from text prompts. After training, T2I models can be adapted to e.g. introduce precise control over the generated content or improve the prompt-following capabilities of the model. This can be realized through either fine-tuning or test-time adaptation methods applied to the T2I model. We aim to explore how to improve upon existing adaptation methods.
