title: Visual explanations for self-supervised learning
description: In this project, we will explore existing techniques for visual explanation to study self-supervised learning models in visual recognition tasks. The main goal of this project is to provide a good visual explanation to better understand what content has been learned by the self-supervised learning models and why they are powerful representation learners.
