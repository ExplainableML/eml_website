title: Cross-domain few-shot learning
description: Most of the existing few-shot learning methods work well when base classes with abundant training examples are semantically close to the novel classes. In this project, we study the challenging cross-domain few-shot learning problem where there is a significant semantic domain gap between base and novel classes.
