title: Analysis of multimodal Models
description: The emergence of Large Multimodal Models(LMMs) has revolutionized many multimodal tasks that were previously considered impractical. However, it is of utmost importance to be aware of their shortcomings as well as their capabilities. One such limitation is that, like any other machine learning system, LMMs may be prone to exhibit human-like biases. We aim to explore how to identify and evaluate these biases and further develop methods to mitigate them.
