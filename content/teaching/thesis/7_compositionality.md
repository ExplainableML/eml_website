title: Measuring the Role of Compositionality in Sequences
description: This project focuses on studying methods to measure the level of compositionality in sequential data. Many sequential datasets contain repeated patterns organized in hierarchical, compositional structures. Extrapolating these patterns as tokens is vital for machine learning models to effectively process and compute representations from sequences. The research will involve conducting a literature review on this topic, testing various measures of compositionality, and exploring different tokenization methods to improve machine learning models. The aim is to enhance our understanding of compositional structures in sequential data and their impact on model performance.
