title: Transferring multimodal knowledge for efficient network adaptation
description: Can the knowledge learned from different modalities - such as language, vision, and audio - be transferred to solve a new task? In this project, we will explore how we can build a generic adaptor; upon easily acquired open-source pre-trained networks by devising a lightweight network and effective supervision signals to solve a new task, i.e. to reuse the representation or supervision from pre-trained networks efficiently without piling up the complexity caused by re-training or fine-tuning.
