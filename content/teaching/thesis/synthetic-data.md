title: Training with Synthetic Data
description: Curating large datasets is expensive. However, recently Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have excelled in crafting visually appealing images from text prompts. This opens the door to the mass-generation of synthetic data for downstream training. We aim to explore how to best use T2I models to generate image suitable for training downstream models on.
