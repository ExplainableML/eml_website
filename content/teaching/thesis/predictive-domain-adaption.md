title: When compositional zero-shot learning meets predictive domain adaptation
description: "Despite their differences, both Predictive Domain Adaptation and Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) require working with composed information: domain description + semantic in PDA, state + objects in CZSL. In this project, we will explore how the advancements on one task can benefit the other, even in the case of limited supervision."
