title: Explanations for audio-visual representation learning
description: Many recent audio-visual representations are learned exploiting the natural alignment of audio and visual information in videos. In this project, we aim to generate explanations for audio-visual representations and we will analyse the power and quality of the natural (temporal/semantic) alignment in different video benchmark datasets used for training.
