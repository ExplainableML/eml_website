title: Measuring the role of compositionality in sequences
description: In this project, you will study the question of how to measure the level of compositionality in sequential data. Many sequential data contain repeated patterns organized in a hierarchical, compositional structure. Extrapolating these patterns as tokens are vital for machine learning models to effectively process and compute representations from sequences. You will conduct literature search and in this topic, test out different measures of compositionality, and explore different tokenization methods to improve machine learning models.
