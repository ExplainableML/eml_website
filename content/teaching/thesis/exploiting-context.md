title: Exploiting context for open world semantic segmentation
description: In this project, we will explore the possibility to perform zero-shot semantic segmentation in an open world, i.e. without any prior assumption on the unseen concepts we will see at test time. In particular, we will analyze the impact that context and external knowledge can have on this challenging scenario.
