# TUM Master's Seminar: Advanced Topics in Vision-Language Models (SS 2024)

## Content

</br>

The seminar aims to explore cutting-edge advancements in the realm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), focusing on various topics crucial to their development and application. Through a deep dive into seminal papers and latest research, students will gain an understanding of how models like CLIP, Llama, and Stable Diffusion work at an architectural and mathematical level. By the end of the seminar, students should have a comprehensive perspective on the current state and future potential of vision-language modeling. They will be equipped to evaluate new research, identify promising applications, and contribute meaningfully to the responsible development of this important field.

</br>

This is a Master's level course. Since these topics are very complex, prior participation in at least one of the following lectures is required:
- Introduction to Deep Learning (IN2346)
- Machine Learning (IN2064)

</br>

Additionally, we recommend to have taken at least one advanced deep learning lecture, for example:
- AML: Deep Generative Models (CIT4230003)
- Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data (IN2323)
- Computer Vision III: Detection, Segmentation, and Tracking (IN2375)
- Machine Learning for 3D Geometry (IN2392)
- Advanced Natural Language Processing (CIT4230002)
- ADL4CV (IN2390)
- ADL4R (IN2349)
or a related practical.

## Organization

</br>

The preliminary meeting will take place at 1pm on Thursday, 8th of Februray 2024 on Zoom. You can find the slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ji2Sp1J-Xtoki5PiuumrQ1LEYfTYdqGl/view?usp=sharing).

</br>

The seminar awards 5 ECTS Credits and will take place in person at [Helmholtz AI Munich](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=48.220675,11.596054&z=17&t=m&hl=en&gl=GB&mapclient=embed&cid=3379363886196135068).

</br>

All students will be matched to __one topic group including a primary paper and two secondary papers__. They are expected to give one short and one long presentation on their primary paper (from the perspective of an __academic reviewer__) as well as a one-slide on the secondary papers from two different perspectives (__industry practitioner__ and __academic researcher__).

</br>

The tentative schedule of the seminar is as follows:
- __Online__ Introductory Session, April 18th, (1-2:30pm), [https://zoom.us/j/94077626596](https://zoom.us/j/94077626596). You can find the slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pqzPd_a5yesIMdaxUu9DR9jHg1jGJeDt/view?usp=sharing).
- __Onsite__ Short presentations on May 16th, 23rd (1-3pm)
- __Onsite__ Long presentations on June 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th, July 4th (1-3pm)
