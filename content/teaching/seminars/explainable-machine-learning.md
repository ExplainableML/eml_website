# Seminar Explainable Machine Learning (WS 21 / 22)

## Content

Current publications on machine learning / computer vision are covered in this seminar. In particular, topics from the area of explainable machine learning (in particular vision and language based deep learning, attention models, transformers) are in focus.

 

This is a Master's level course. Since these topics are very complex, prior participation in at least one of the following lectures is required:

Deep Learning
Probabilistic Machine Learning
Statistical Machine Learning

## Organisation

The schedule of the seminar is as follows:

October 20th, 2-6pm
October 27th, 2-6pm
November 3rd, 2-6pm 
November 10th, 2-6pm
November 17th, 2-6pm
November 24th, 2-6pm
December 1st, 2-6pm

All seminars will take place on zoom. All the accepted participants will receive the zoom link on their email that they used in ILIAS.

The course awards 3 LP Credits.

## Requirements

A successful participation in the seminar includes:

Active participation in the entire event: We have 70% attendance policy for this seminar. You need to attend at least 5 of the 7 sessions.
Short presentation on October 27th or November 3rd (10 minutes talk, 5 min questions)
Presentation on November 10th, November 17th, November 24th or December 1st (20 minutes talk, 10 minutes questions) on a selected topic
