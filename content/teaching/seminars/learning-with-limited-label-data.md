# Seminar Learning with Limited Label Data (WS 21 / 22)
## Content

Current publications on machine learning / computer vision are covered in this seminar. In this seminar, we will discuss research papers related to visual learning with limited labeled data, including deep learning methods for zero-shot and few-shot learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised pre-training, and self-supervised learning.

This is a Master's level course. Since these topics are very complex, prior participation in at least one of the following lectures is required:

General knowledge on Statistical Machine Learning
General knowledge on Deep Learning
General knowledge on Computer Vision
 

## Organisation

The schedule of the seminar is as follows:

October 22th, 2-4pm            
October 29th, 2-4pm            
November 5th, 2-4pm            
November 12th, 2-4pm            
November 19th, 2-6pm            
November 26th, 2-6pm            
December 3rd, 2-6pm            
December 10th, 2-6pm            
December 17th, 2-6pm
All seminars will take place on zoom. All the accepted participants will receive the zoom link on their email that they used in ILIAS.

The course awards 3 LP Credits.
