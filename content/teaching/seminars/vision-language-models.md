# TUM Master's Seminar: Advanced Topics in Vision-Language Models (SS 2024)

## Content

</br>

Current publications on Vision-Language Models will be discussed in this seminar. These will be based around SOTA models like CLIP, Llava, and Stable-Diffusion.

</br>

This is a Master's level course. Since these topics are very complex, prior participation in at least one of the following lectures is required:
- Introduction to Deep Learning (IN2346)
- Machine Learning (IN2064)

</br>

Additionally, we recommend to have taken at least one advanced deep learning lecture, for example:
- AML: Deep Generative Models (CIT4230003)
- Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data (IN2323)
- Computer Vision III: Detection, Segmentation, and Tracking (IN2375)
- Machine Learning for 3D Geometry (IN2392)
- Advanced Natural Language Processing (CIT4230002)
- ADL4CV (IN2390)
- ADL4R (IN2349)
or a related practical.

## Topics to select from:
- Zero/few-shot learning in large VLMs
- Language guidance in computer vision
- Personalized text2img models
- Compositionality
- Foundation VLMs

## Organisation

</br>

The preliminary meeting will take place at 1pm on Thursday, 8th of Februray 2024 on Zoom [https://zoom.us/j/92673399783](https://zoom.us/j/92673399783) . Afterwards, the slides will be uploaded here.
