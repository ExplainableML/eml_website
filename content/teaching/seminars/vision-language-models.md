# Seminar: Advanced Topics in Vision-Language Models (SS 2024)\
\
## Content
Current publications on Vision-Language Models will be discussed in this seminar. These will be based around SOTA models like CLIP, Llava, and Stable-Diffusion.\

This is a Master's level course. Since these topics are very complex, prior participation in at least one of the following lectures is required:
- Introduction to Deep Learning (IN2346)
- Machine Learning (IN2064)\

Additionally, we recommend to have taken at least one advanced deep learning lecture, for example:
- AML: Deep Generative Models (CIT4230003)
- Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data (IN2323)
- Computer Vision III: Detection, Segmentation, and Tracking (IN2375)
- Machine Learning for 3D Geometry (IN2392)
- Advanced Natural Language Processing (CIT4230002)
- ADL4CV (IN2390)
- ADL4R (IN2349)
or a related practical.\

## Topics to select from:
### 1. Zero/few-shot learning in large VLMs
### 2. Language guidance in computer vision
### 3. Personalized text2img models
### 4. Compositionality
### 5. Foundation VLMs

## Organisation
The preliminary meeting will take place at 1pm on Thursday, 8th of Februray 2024 on Zoom ([https://zoom.us/j/92673399783](https://zoom.us/j/92673399783)). Afterwards, the slides will be uploaded here.\

The seminar awards 5 ECTS Credits and will take place in person at [Helmholtz AI Munich](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=48.220675,11.596054&z=17&t=m&hl=en&gl=GB&mapclient=embed&cid=3379363886196135068).\

All students will be matched to one topic group including a primary paper and two secondary papers. They are expect to give one short presentation, a long presentation on their primary paper. Additionally, the should present a very short one-slide covering their secondary papers from a specified role and submit a two page final report on the seminar.\

The tentative schedule of the seminar is as follows:
- Online Introductory Session, April 18th, (1-2:30pm)
