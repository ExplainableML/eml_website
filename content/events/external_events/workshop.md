<br/>

Deep learning has enabled major advances in machine learning. However, the deployment of deep learning frameworks in settings that are safety-critical or that impact society requires their decision-making to be explainable. This is fundamental for building trustworthy and user-oriented machine learning models. The aim of this workshop is to generate awareness around explainability in machine learning which is a topic of growing interest. Furthermore, we aim to encourage interdisciplinary interaction and collaboration between researchers from the University of Tübingen and other international institutions that work on different aspects of explainability, in particular in the context of computer vision.

<br/>

Our workshop will consider research on approaches to explainability and on applications of explainability. Topics of interest will include (but will not be limited to):<br/>
<br/>
* Computer vision (and visual explanations)
* Natural language processing
* Explanations for medical applications
* Autonomous driving
* Fairness
* Causality

Participants will also have the chance to explore the old university town of Tübingen. The city combines the ancient medieval atmosphere with the vibrant life of a cosmopolitan student town. You can get lost in the narrow alleys and timber-framed houses that lead to the 500-years old castle, take a boat trip in the famous "Stocherkahn" or enjoy the tasteful Swabian cuisine.
